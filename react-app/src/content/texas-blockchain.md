[Texas Blockchain](https://www.texasblockchain.org/) is a student organization at UT Austin focused on exploring and building blockchain-related products and services. Over nearly 3 years, I went from being a freshman member to President in my junior year scaling the org into the top five university blockchain clubs in the nation. 

## By the Numbers

The scale of what we built—especially for an undergraduate organization—was something I'm incredibly proud of:

- **$100,000+** raised in funding
- **$55,000** in hackathon grants distributed
- **$12,500** in startup grants
- **30+ partners** including Solana, Ethereum Foundation, Binance, Avalanche, and UT Austin faculty
- **20 ETH** deployed across 13 investments
- **2 hackathons** hosted, **4 hackathons** attended (won $3,600 in bounties)
- Expanded to become a **state-wide organization**

## What I Learned

Leading Texas Blockchain taught me how to manage different teams, build partnerships with industry leaders, and secure funding at scale. Taking an organization from a 10 person campus club to a multi-university operation with six-figure budgets and partnerships with some of the biggest names in crypto is an experience that I'll always value.
